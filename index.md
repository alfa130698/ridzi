## What is Kotlin

According to Wikipedia : Kotlin (/ˈkɒtlɪn/)[2] is a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose programming language with type inference. Kotlin is designed to interoperate fully with Java, and the JVM version of Kotlin's standard library depends on the Java Class Library,[3] but type inference allows its syntax to be more concise. Kotlin mainly targets the JVM, but also compiles to JavaScript (for e.g. frontend web applications using React[4]) or native code (via LLVM), e.g. for native iOS apps sharing business logic with Android apps.[5] Language development costs are borne by JetBrains, while the Kotlin Foundation protects the Kotlin trademark.[6] 

### Example Hello Wolrd
```kotlin
fun main(){
    println("Hello Wolrd")
}
```
### Val and Var
Val or Value is something you declare and cannot change, but Var is Variable which is you can change real time.
For instance, see example below:
```kotlin
fun main(){
    val x = "malam"
    var y = "minggu"
    
    println("Sekarang $x $y")
}
```
and the output is

```
Sekarang malam minggu
```
